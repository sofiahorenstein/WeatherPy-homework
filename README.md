# WeatherPy-homework

In this assignment, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of about 600 unique cities across the world of varying distance from the equator to answer the question "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?". I used current data from the OpenWeatherMap API, matplotlib, and pandas to create a representative model of weather across world cities utilizing a series of successive API calls.

In my analysis I built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
